page.iht.application.gifts.guidance.claimingExemptions.reveal.income.description4 = If the total value of gifts made out of income is over £3,000, none of that amount is exempt. All of the gift will be added to the estate value if it can’t be used against the annual gift exemption.
page.iht.application.gifts.guidance.claimingExemptions.reveal.income.description5 = If the deceased had a direct debit set up to gift a charity £50 a month, the total amount gifted in a year would be £600. This amount would be exempt if it was the only gift given away on a regular basis by the deceased that year.
page.iht.application.gifts.guidance.claimingExemptions.reveal.income.description6 = If the deceased also gifted £250 a month to another charity then the value they would receive would be £3,000.

page.iht.application.gifts.guidance.claimingExemptions.reveal.annualGift.description4 = If the deceased gave their child £6,000 when they married, you could use the first £5,000 under the marriage or civil partnership gift exemption and the remaining £1,000 under the annual gift exemption.

page.iht.application.gifts.guidance.increasingAnnualLimit.description1 = The only exemption that can be increased is the annual exemption.
page.iht.application.gifts.guidance.increasingAnnualLimit.description2 = If no gifts were given away in 1 year, or if the annual exemption isn’t used in 1 year, that amount will rollover to the next year.
page.iht.application.gifts.guidance.increasingAnnualLimit.description3 = Remember that the starting figure for each financial year is £3,000.
page.iht.application.gifts.guidance.increasingAnnualLimit.description4 = If no annual exemption is claimed for the financial year 2012 to 2013, you can increase the exempt amount for 2013 to 2014 to £6,000.
page.iht.application.gifts.guidance.increasingAnnualLimit.description5 = If there was £1,000 of the annual exemption claimed in 2012 to 2013 that means £2,000 wasn’t used for that financial year.
