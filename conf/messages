page.iht.application.gifts.guidance.claimingExemptions.reveal.smallGifts.description1 = The small gifts exemption covers up to £250 of gifts given to a person but there’s no limit to how many people can each receive that amount in any financial year.

page.iht.application.gifts.guidance.claimingExemptions.reveal.smallGifts.description2 = If anyone received more than £250 then the full amount they were given should be included as a gift value in that year.
page.iht.application.gifts.guidance.claimingExemptions.reveal.smallGifts.description3 = If John is given £300 in one year and Mary is given £200 then you could claim an exemption against what Mary was given but the full £300 given to John would be added to the value of the estate.

page.iht.application.gifts.guidance.claimingExemptions.reveal.marriageOrCivilPartner.description3.part1 = their child £5,000 when they married or had their civil partnership ceremony

page.iht.application.gifts.guidance.claimingExemptions.reveal.marriageOrCivilPartner.description5 = If the deceased gave their son £7,000 as a marriage gift, you can use the first £5,000 against the marriage exemption and then allocate the remaining £2,000 against the annual exemption rules.
page.iht.application.gifts.guidance.claimingExemptions.reveal.income.heading = Gifts that can be claimed using the gifts out of income exemption
page.iht.application.gifts.guidance.claimingExemptions.reveal.income.description1 = Gifts made out of income must be a regular payment made to someone with up to £3,000 in each financial year being exempt.
page.iht.application.gifts.guidance.claimingExemptions.reveal.income.description2 = There must be a pattern of this being given away, like monthly payments over a period of time.
page.iht.application.gifts.guidance.claimingExemptions.reveal.income.description3 = You can use this exemption with any other one apart from small gifts.
page.iht.application.gifts.guidance.claimingExemptions.reveal.income.description4 = If the total value of gifts made out of income is over £3,000, none of that amount is exempt. All of the gift will be added to the estate value if it can’t be used against the annual gift exemption.
page.iht.application.gifts.guidance.claimingExemptions.reveal.income.description5 = If the deceased had a direct debit set up to gift a charity £50 a month, the total amount gifted in a year would be £600. This amount would be exempt if it was the only gift given away on a regular basis by the deceased that year.
page.iht.application.gifts.guidance.claimingExemptions.reveal.income.description6 = If the deceased also gifted £250 a month to another charity then the value they would receive would be £3,000. Added to the amount given to the first charity, the deceased gifted more than £3,000 in a year and so the gifts out of income exemption can’t be used.
page.iht.application.gifts.guidance.claimingExemptions.reveal.annualGift.heading = Gifts that can be claimed using the annual gift exemption
page.iht.application.gifts.guidance.claimingExemptions.reveal.annualGift.description1 = The annual gifts exemption can be used to cover anything given away and the first £3,000 of gifts made in any financial year is exempt.
page.iht.application.gifts.guidance.claimingExemptions.reveal.annualGift.description2 = Any unused exemption total can be rolled over to the following financial year. This means that in any one financial year the exemption could be up to £6,000 if the previous year had none of the exempt amount used.
page.iht.application.gifts.guidance.claimingExemptions.reveal.annualGift.description3 = You can use this exemption with the marriage or civil partnership gift exemption and the gifts out of income exemption.
page.iht.application.gifts.guidance.claimingExemptions.reveal.annualGift.description4 = If the deceased gave their child £6,000 when they married, you could use the first £5,000 under the marriage or civil partnership gift exemption and the remaining £1,000 under the annual gift exemption.

page.iht.application.gifts.guidance.increasingAnnualLimit.title = Increasing the annual exemption amount
page.iht.application.gifts.guidance.increasingAnnualLimit.description1 = The only exemption that can be increased is the annual exemption.
page.iht.application.gifts.guidance.increasingAnnualLimit.description2 = If no gifts were given away in 1 year, or if the annual exemption isn’t used in 1 year, that amount will rollover to the next year.
page.iht.application.gifts.guidance.increasingAnnualLimit.description3 = Remember that the starting figure for each financial year is £3,000.
page.iht.application.gifts.guidance.increasingAnnualLimit.description4 = If no annual exemption is claimed for the financial year 2012 to 2013, you can increase the exempt amount for 2013 to 2014 to £6,000.
page.iht.application.gifts.guidance.increasingAnnualLimit.description5 = If there was £1,000 of the annual exemption claimed in 2012 to 2013 that means £2,000 wasn’t used for that financial year. You can then rollover £2,000 to the next financial year so the exempt amount for the annual exemption for 2013 to 2014 becomes £5,000.

page.iht.application.gifts.guidance.giftsGivenAway.title = Work out what gifts were given away
page.iht.application.gifts.guidance.giftsGivenAway.description1 = It might take some time to work out what was given away so it’s best to collect as much detail as possible, talk to as many people as you can who might’ve been given something by the deceased and check bank statements for sums of money that can’t be accounted for.
